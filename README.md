# LB_API_Project
Simple API built in C# that returns information on US Federal Holidays given dates from 2021-2023.


# Instructions to Build and Run Project
    1. Download and install preferred IDE (JetBrains Rider or Microsoft Visual Studio recommended)
    2. 


# API Endpoint that can be Called
    1. /
    2. /isHoliday


# External Libraries Used
    1. System.Data.SQLite   -->   version # 1.0.116


# SQLite Database Schema


# Assumptions Made
    1. I assumed the accepted date could be simply added at the end of the url request (https://localhost:9999/endpoint/date) rather than submitted as a parameter.
    2. I assumed it was okay for the user/evaluator of this project to use an IDE to build and run the project rather than building and running it on a server or command line interface.


# Feedback


# General Notes
Overall, I'm extremely happy with the outcome of this project. When I read the first sentence of the Assignment description "Build a simple API, preferably in C#",
I was a bit overwhelmed because I've never built an API and I've never coded a single line of C# before. It was challenging in many ways and I was seriously ecstatic
that I was able to dive in and complete this project. I think my lack of C# experience is evident in the code, which I think is okay because I had fun, learned a ton, 
and understand I have a lot more to learn.


# Time Spent
    - So far: 15 hours


# Problems/Issues
    - Returning an actual JSON object...


# Enhancements
    1. Adding user authentication logic with an API token
    2. Adding a user input option and endpoint for a date range rather than a specific date that would return all holidays in the specified date range.
